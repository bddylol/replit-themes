# replit-themes
Here's a list of all the repl themes me and other contributors currently making!


## Installation
To install any theme, you must have a CSS injector.

Copy the CSS stylesheet of your liking and take the code and paste it into your injector.

You can also use this following script in the console:
```js
let el = document.createElement('link');

el.setAttribute('rel', 'stylesheet');
el.setAttribute('type', 'text/css');
el.setAttribute('href', 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/buddy-codes/replit-themes/<filename>.min.css');
// Example of this URL: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/buddy-codes/replit-themes/discord.repl.theme.min.css

document.head.appendChild(el);
```
